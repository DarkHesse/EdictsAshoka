first pillar-edict;99;delhi-topra;king devānāṃpriya priyadarśin speaks thus.;this rescript on morality was caused to be written by me (when i had been) anointed twenty-six years.;(happiness) in this (world) and in the other (world) is difficult to secure without great love of morality, careful examination, great obedience, great fear (of sin), (and) great energy.;but indeed by my instruction this regard for morality and love of morality have been promoted day by day and will progress still (more).;and my agents also, both the high ones and the low ones, and those of middle rank, are conforming to and practising (morality), (and are thus) able to stir up fickle (persons).;in the same way the mahāmātras of the borderers also (are acting).;for (their) instruction (is) this, viz. to protect according to morality, to dispose according to morality, to cause pleasure according to morality, (and) to guard (their speech) according to morality.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
first separate rock-edict;99;dhauli;at the word of devānāṁpriya, the mahāmātras at tosali, (who are) the judicial officers of the city, have to be told (thus).;whatever i recognize (to be right), that i strive to carry out by deeds, and to accomplish by (various) means.;and this is considered by me the principal means for this object, viz. (to give) instruction to you.;for you are occupied with many thousands of men, with the object of gaining the affection of men.;all men are my children.;as on behalf of (my own) children i desire that they may be provided with complete welfare and happiness in this world and in the other world, the same i desire also on behalf of [all]men.;and you do not learn how far this (my) object reaches.;some single person only learns this, (and) even he (only) a portion, (but) not the whole.;now you must pay attention to this, although you are well provided for.;it happens in the administration (of justice) that a single person suffers either imprisonment or harsh treatment.;in this case (an order) cancelling the imprisonment is (obtained) by him accidentally, while [many] other people continue to suffer.;in this case you must strive to deal (with all of them) impartially.;but one fails to act (thus) on account of the following dispositions: envy, anger, cruelty, hurry, want of practice, laziness, (and) fatigue.;(you) must strive for this, that these dispositions may not arise to you.;and the root of all this is the absence of anger and the avoidance of hurry.;he who is fatigued in the administration (of justice), will not rise, but one ought to move, to walk, and to advance.;he who will pay attention to this, must tell you: ‘see that (you) discharge the debt (which you owe to the king), such and such is the instruction of devānāṁpriya.’;the observance of this produces great fruit, (but its) non-observance (becomes) a great evil.;for if one fails to observe this, there will be neither attainment of heaven nor satisfaction of the king.;for how (could) my mind be pleased if one badly fulfils this duty?;but if (you) observe this, you will attain heaven, and you will discharge the debt (which you owe) to me.;and this edict must be listened to (by all on (every day of) the constellation tishya.;and it may be listened to even by a single (person) also on frequent (other) occasions between (the days of) tishya.;and if (you) act thus, you will be able to fulfil (this duty).;for the following purpose has this rescript been written here, (viz.) in order that the judicial officers of the city may strive at all times (for this), (that] neither undeserved fettering nor undeserved harsh treatment are happening to [men].;and for the following purpose i shall send out every five years [a mahāmātra] who will be neither harsh nor fierce, (but) of gentle actions, (viz. in order to ascertain) whether (the judicial officers), paying attention to this object, ..... are acting thus, as my instruction (implies).;but from ujjayinī also the prince (governor) will send out for the same purpose ….. a person of the same description, and he will not allow (more than) three years to pass (without such a deputation).  (bb) in the same way (an officer will be deputed) from takshaśilā also.  (cc) when ..... these mahāmātras will set out on tour, then, without neglecting their own duties, they will ascertain this as well, (viz.) whether (the]udicial officers) are carrying out this also thus, as the instruction of the king (implies).;
