thirteenth rock-edict, 13, kalsi, 2, one hundred and fifty thousand in number were the men who were deported thence. one hundred thousand in number were those who were slain there. and many times as many those who died.
thirteenth rock-edict, 13, kalsi, 3, after that. now that (the country of) the kaliṅgyas has been taken. devānaṁpriya (is devoted) to a zealous study of morality. to the love of morality. and to the instruction (of people) in morality.
thirteenth rock-edict, 13, kalsi, 4, this is the repentance of devānāṁpriya on account of his conquest of (the country of) the kaliṅgyas.
thirteenth rock-edict, 13, kalsi, 5, for. this is considered very painful and deplorable by devānāṁpriya. that. while one is conquering an unconquered (country). slaughter. death. and deportation of people (are taking place) there.
thirteenth rock-edict, 13, kalsi, 6, but the following is considered even more deplorable than this by devānāṁpriya.
thirteenth rock-edict, 13, kalsi, 7, (to) the brāhmaṇas or śramaṇas. or other sects or householders. who are living there. (and) among whom the following are practised: obedience to those who receive high pay. obedience to mother and father. obedience to elders. proper courtesy to friends. acquaintances. companions. and relatives. to slaves and servants. (and) firm devotion.–to these then happen injury or slaughter or deportation of (their) beloved ones.
thirteenth rock-edict, 13, kalsi, 8, or if there are then incurring misfortune the friends. acquaintances. companions. and relatives of those whose affection (for the latter) is undiminished. although they are (themselves) well provided for. this (misfortune) as well becomes an injury to those (persons) themselves.
thirteenth rock-edict, 13, kalsi, 9, this is shared by all men and is considered deplorable by devānāṁpriya.
thirteenth rock-edict, 13, kalsi, 10, there is no country where these (two) classes. (viz.) the brāhmaṇas and the śramaṇas. do not exist. except among the yonas. and there is no (place) in any country where men are not indeed attached to some sect.
thirteenth rock-edict, 13, kalsi, 11, therefore even the hundredth part or the thousandth part of all those people who were slain. who died. and who were deported at that time when (the country of) the kaliṅgas was taken. (would) now be considered very deplorable by devānāṁpriya.  ...
thirteenth rock-edict, 13, kalsi, 12, .......... desires towards all beings .......... self-control. impartiality. (and) kindness.
thirteenth rock-edict, 13, kalsi, 13, but this .......... by devānāṁpriya. viz. the conquest by morality.

(where) four–4–kings (are ruling). (viz. the king) named tulamaya. (the king) named antekina. (the king) named makā. (and the king) named alikyashudala. (and) likewise towards the south. (where) the choḍas and pāṇḍyas (are ruling). as far as tāmraparṇī.

thirteenth rock-edict, 13, kalsi, 17, this conquest. which has been won by this everywhere. causes the feeling of satisfaction.
thirteenth rock-edict, 13, kalsi, 18, firm becomes this satisfaction. (viz.) the satisfaction at the conquest by morality.
thirteenth rock-edict, 13, kalsi, 19, but this satisfaction is indeed of little (consequence).
thirteenth rock-edict, 13, kalsi, 20, devānāṁpriya thinks that only the fruits in the other (world) are of great (value).
thirteenth rock-edict, 13, kalsi, 21, and for the following purpose has this rescript on morality been written. (viz.) in order that the sons (and) great-grandsons (who) may be (born) to me. should not think that a fresh conquest ought to be made. (that). if a conquest does please them. they should take pleasures in mercy and light punishments. and (that) they should regard the conquest by morality as the only (true) conquest.

first pillar-edict, 99, delhi-topra, 2, this rescript on morality was caused to be written by me (when i had been) anointed twenty-six years.
first pillar-edict, 99, delhi-topra, 3, (happiness) in this (world) and in the other (world) is difficult to secure without great love of morality. careful examination. great obedience. great fear (of sin). (and) great energy.

first separate rock-edict, 99, dhauli, 4, for you are occupied with many thousands of men. with the object of gaining the affection of men.
first separate rock-edict, 99, dhauli, 5, all men are my children.
first separate rock-edict, 99, dhauli, 6, as on behalf of (my own) children i desire that they may be provided with complete welfare and happiness in this world and in the other world. the same i desire also on behalf of [all]men.
first separate rock-edict, 99, dhauli, 7, and you do not learn how far this (my) object reaches.
first separate rock-edict, 99, dhauli, 8, some single person only learns this. (and) even he (only) a portion. (but) not the whole.
first separate rock-edict, 99, dhauli, 9, now you must pay attention to this. although you are well provided for.
first separate rock-edict, 99, dhauli, 10, it happens in the administration (of justice) that a single person suffers either imprisonment or harsh treatment.
first separate rock-edict, 99, dhauli, 11, in this case (an order) cancelling the imprisonment is (obtained) by him accidentally. while [many] other people continue to suffer.
first separate rock-edict, 99, dhauli, 12, in this case you must strive to deal (with all of them) impartially.
first separate rock-edict, 99, dhauli, 13, but one fails to act (thus) on account of the following dispositions: envy. anger. cruelty. hurry. want of practice. laziness. (and) fatigue.
first separate rock-edict, 99, dhauli, 14, (you) must strive for this. that these dispositions may not arise to you.
first separate rock-edict, 99, dhauli, 15, and the root of all this is the absence of anger and the avoidance of hurry.
first separate rock-edict, 99, dhauli, 16, he who is fatigued in the administration (of justice). will not rise. but one ought to move. to walk. and to advance.
first separate rock-edict, 99, dhauli, 17, he who will pay attention to this. must tell you: ‘see that (you) discharge the debt (which you owe to the king). such and such is the instruction of devānāṁpriya.’
first separate rock-edict, 99, dhauli, 18, the observance of this produces great fruit. (but its) non-observance (becomes) a great evil.
first separate rock-edict, 99, dhauli, 19, for if one fails to observe this. there will be neither attainment of heaven nor satisfaction of the king.

first separate rock-edict, 99, dhauli, 27, but from ujjayinī also the prince (governor) will send out for the same purpose ….. a person of the same description. and he will not allow (more than) three years to pass (without such a deputation).  (bb) in the same way (an officer will be deputed) from takshaśilā also.  (cc) when ..... these mahāmātras will set out on tour. then. without neglecting their own duties. they will ascertain this as well. (viz.) whether (the]udicial officers) are carrying out this also thus. as the instruction of the king (implies).
second separate rock-edict, 99, dhauli, 1, at the word of devānāṁpriya. the prince (governor) and the mahāmātras at tosalī have to be told (thus).

second separate rock-edict, 99, dhauli, 6, it might occur to (my) unconquered borderers (to ask): ‘what does the king desire with reference to us?’
second separate rock-edict, 99, dhauli, 7, [this] alone is my wish with reference to the borderers. that they may learn that devānāṁpriya .......... that they may not be afraid of me. but may have confidence (in me). that they may obtain only happiness from me. not misery. that they may [learn] this. that devānāṁpriya will forgive them what can be forgiven. that they may (be induced) by me (to) practise morality. (and) that they may attain (happiness in) this world and (in) the other world.
second separate rock-edict, 99, dhauli, 8, for the following purpose i am instructing you. (viz. that) i may discharge the debt (which i owe to them) by this. that i instruct (you) and inform (you) of (my) will. i.e. my unshakable resolution and vow.
second separate rock-edict, 99, dhauli, 9, therefore. acting thus. (you) must fulfil (your) duty and must inspire confidence to them. in order that they may learn that devānāṁpriya is to them like a father. that devānāṁpriya loves them like himself. and that they are to devānāṁpriya like (his own) children.
second separate rock-edict, 99, dhauli, 10, therefore. having instructed (you). and having informed you of (my) will. i shall have (i.e. entertain) officers in (all) provinces for this object.
