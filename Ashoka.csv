THIRD ROCK-EDICT,GIRNAR,King Devānāṃpriya Priyadarśin speaks thus.,(When I had been) anointed twelve years; the following was ordered by me.,Everywhere in my dominions the Yuktas; the Rājūka; and the Prādeśika shall set out on a complete tour (throughout their charges) every five years for this very purpose; (viz.) for the following instruction in morality as well as for other business.,‘Meritorious is obedience to mother and father.

FOURTH ROCK-EDICT,GIRNAR,In times past; for many hundreds of years; there had ever been promoted the killing of animals and the hurting of living beings; discourtesy to relatives; (and) discourtesy to Brāhmaṇas and Śramaṇas.,But now; in consequence of the practice of morality on the part of king Devānāṁpriya Priyadarśin; the sound of drums has become the sound of morality; showing the people representations of aerial chariots; representations of elephants; masses of fire; and other divine figures.,Such as they had not existed before for many hundreds of years; thus there are now promoted; through the instruction in morality on the part of king Devānāṁpriya Priyadarsin; abstention from killing animals; abstention from hurting living beings; courtesy to relatives; courtesy to Brāhmaṇas and Śramaṇas; obedience to mother (and) father; (and) obedience to the aged.,In this and many other ways is the practice of morality promoted.,And king Devānāṁpriya Priyadarśin will ever promote this practice of morality.,And the sons; grandsons; and great-grandsons of king Devānāṁpriya Priyadarśin will promote this practice of morality until the æon of destruction (of the world) (and) will instruct (people) in morality; abiding by morality (and) by good conduct.,For this is the best work; viz. instruction in morality.,And the practice of morality is not (possible) for (a person) devoid of good conduct.,Therefore promotion and not neglect of this object is meritorious.,For the following purpose has this been caused to be written; (viz. in order that) they should devote themselves to the promotion of this practice; and that the neglect (of it) should not be approved (by them).,This was caused to be written by king Devānāṁpriya Priyadarśin (when he had been) anointed twelve years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FIFTH ROCK-EDICT,GIRNAR,King Devānāṁpriya Priyadarśin speaks thus.,It is difficult to perform virtuous deeds.,He who starts performing virtuous deeds accomplishes something difficult.,Now; by me many virtuous deeds have been performed.,Therefore (among) my sons and grandsons; and (among) my descendants (who shall come) after them until the æon of destruction (of the world); those who will conform to this (duty) will perform good deeds.,But he who will neglect even a portion of this (duty) will perform evil deeds.,For sin is easily committed.,In times past (officers) called Mahāmātras of morality (Dharma-mahāmātra) did not exist before.,But Mahāmātras of morality were appointed by me (when I had been) anointed thirteen years.,These are occupied with all sects in establishing morality ……… of those who are devoted to morality (even) among the Yoṇas; Kambojas; and Gandhāras; the Risṭikas and Peteṇikas; and whatever other western borderers (of mine there are).,They are occupied with servants and masters ……… for the ……… happiness of those who are devoted to morality; (and) in freeing (them) from desire (for worldly life).,They are occupied in supporting prisoners 6 (with money) ……… (if one has) children; or with those who are bewitched (i.e. incurably ill ?) or with the aged.,They are occupied everywhere; both in Pāṭaliputra and in the outlying ……… and whatever other relatives of mine (there are).,These Mahāmātras of morality ……… whether one is eager for morality ………,For the following purpose has this rescript on morality been written ………,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SIXTH ROCK-EDICT,GIRNAR,King Devānāṁpriya Priyadarśin speaks thus.,In times past neither the disposal of affairs nor the submission of reports at any time did exist before.,But I have made the following (arrangement).,Reporters are posted everywhere; (with instructions) to report to me the affairs of the people at any time; while I am eating; in the harem; in the inner apartment; even at the cowpen; in the palanquin; and in the parks.,And everywhere I am disposing of the affairs of the people.,And if in the council (of Mahāmātras) a dispute arises; or an amendment is moved; in connexion with any donation or proclamation which I myself am ordering verbally; or (in connexion with) an emergent matter which has been delegated to the Mahāmātras; it must be reported to me immediately; anywhere; (and) at any time.,Thus I have ordered.,For I am never content in exerting myself and in dispatching business.,For I consider it my duty (to promote) the welfare of all men.,But the root of that (is) this; (viz.) exertion and the dispatch of business.,For no duty is more important than (promoting) the welfare of all men.,And whatever effort I am making; (is made) in order that I may discharge the debt (which I owe) to living beings; (that) I may make them happy in this (world); and (that) they may attain heaven in the other (world).,For the following purpose has this rescript on morality been caused to be written; (viz.) that it may last long; and that my sons; grandsons; and great-grandsons may conform to this for the welfare of all men.,But it is difficult to accomplish this without great zeal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SEVENTH ROCK-EDICT,GIRNAR,King Devānāṁpriya Priyadarśin desires (that) all sects may reside everywhere.,(For) all these desire both self-control and purity of mind.,But men possess various desires (and) various passions.,Either they will fulfil the whole; or they will fulfil (only) a portion (of their duties).,But even one who (practises) great liberality; (but) does not possess self-control; purity of mind; gratitude; and firm devotion; is very mean.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EIGHTH ROCK-EDICT,GIRNAR,In times past kings used to set out on pleasure-tours.,On these (tours) hunting and other such pleasures were (enjoyed).,But when king Devānāṁpriya Priyadarśin had been anointed ten years; he went to Saṁbodhi.,Therefore these tours of morality (were undertaken).,On these (tours) the following 3 takes place; (viz.) visiting Brāhmaṇas and Śramaṇas and making gifts (to them); visiting the aged and supporting (them) with gold; visiting the people of the country; instructing (them) in morality; and questioning (them) about morality; as suitable for this (occasion).,This second period (of the reign) of king Devānāṁpriya Priyadarśin becomes a pleasure in a higher degree.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NINTH ROCK-EDICT,GIRNAR,King Devānāṁpriya Priyadarśin speaks thus.,Men are practising various ceremonies during illness; or at the marriage of a son or a daughter; or at the birth of a son; or when setting out on a journey; on these and other (occasions) men are practising various ceremonies.,But in such (cases) women are practising many and various vulgar and useless ceremonies.,Now; ceremonies should certainly be practised.,But ceremonies like these bear little fruit indeed.,But the following practice bears much fruit; viz. the practice of morality.,Herein the following (are comprised); (viz.) proper courtesy to slaves and servants; reverence to elders; gentleness to animals; (and) liberality to Brāhmaṇas and Śramaṇas; these and other such (virtues) are called the practice of morality.,Therefore a father; or a son; or a brother; or a master ought to say:- ‘This is meritorious. This practice should be observed until the (desired) object is attained.’,And it has been said also: ‘Gifts are meritorious.’,But there is no such gift or benefit as the gift of morality or the benefit of morality.,Therefore a friend; or a well-wisher; or a relative; or a companion should indeed admonish (another) on such and such an occasion: – ‘This ought to be done; this is meritorious. By this (practice) it is possible to attain heaven.’,And what is more desirable than this; viz. the attainment of heaven?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TENTH ROCK-EDICT,GIRNAR,King Devānāṁpriya Priyadarśin does not think that either glory or fame conveys much advantage; except (on account of his aim that) in the present time; and in the distant (future); men may (be induced) by him to practise obedience to morality; and that they may conform to the duties of morality.,On this (account) king Devānāṁpriya Priyadarśin is desiring glory and fame.,But whatever effort king Devānāṁpriya Priyadarśin is making; all that (is) for the sake of (merit) in the other (world); (and) in order that all (men) may run little danger.,But the danger is this; viz. demerit.,But it is indeed difficult either for a lowly person or for a high one to accomplish this without great zeal (and without) laying aside every (other aim).10,But among these (two) it is indeed (more) difficult to accomplish for a high (person).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ELEVENTH ROCK-EDICT,GIRNAR,King Devānāṁpriya Priyadarśin speaks thus.,There is no such gift as the gift of morality; or acquaintance through morality; or the distribution of morality; or kinship through morality.,Herein the following are (comprised); (viz.) proper courtesy to slaves and servants; obedience to mother (and) father; liberality to friends; acquaintances; and relatives; to Brāhmaṇas and Śramaṇas;(and) abstention from killing animals.12,Concerning this a father; or a son; or a brother; or a friend; an acquaintance; or a relative; (or) even (mere) neighbours; ought to say : ‘This is meritorious. This; ought to be done.’,If one is acting thus; the attainment of (happiness) in this world is (secured); and endless merit is produced in the other (world) by that gift of morality.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TWELFTH ROCK-EDICT,GIRNAR,King Devānaṁpriya Priyadarśin is honouring all sects: both ascetics and householders; both with gifts and with honours of various kinds he is honouring them.,But Devānaṁpriya does not value either gifts or honours so (highly) as (this); (viz.) that a promotion of the essentials of all sects should take place.,But a promotion of the essentials (is possible) in many ways.,But its root is this; viz. guarding (one’s) speech (i. e) that neither praising one’s own sect nor blaming other sect should take place on improper occasions; or (that) it should be moderate in every case.,But other sects ought to be duly honoured in every case.,If one is acting thus; he is both promoting his own sect and benefiting other sects.,If one is acting otherwise than thus; he is both hurting his own sect and wronging other sects as well.,For whosoever praises his own sect or blames other sects;–all (this) out of devotion to his own sect; (i.e.) with the view of glorifying his own sect;–if he is acting thus; he rather injures his own sect very severely.,Therefore concord alone is meritorious; (i.e.) that they should both hear and obey each other's morals.,For this is the desire of Devānaṁpriya; (viz.) that all sects should be full of learning; and should be pure in doctrine.,And those who are attached to their respective (sects) ought to be spoken to 1 (as follows).,Devānaṁpriya does not value either gifts or honours so (highly) as (this); (viz.) that a promotion of the essentials of all sects should take place.,And many (officers) are occupied for this purpose; (viz.) the Mahāmātras of morality; the Mahāmātras controlling women; the inspectors of cowpens; and other classes (of officials).,And this is the fruit of it; (viz.) that both the promotion of one's own sect takes place; and the glorification of morality.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

THIRTEENTH ROCK-EDICT,KALSI,When king Devānāṁpriya Priyadarśin had been anointed eight years; (the country of) the Kaliligyas was conquered by (him).,One hundred and fifty thousand in number were the men who were deported thence; one hundred thousand in number were those who were slain there; and many times as many those who died.,After that; now that (the country of) the Kaliṅgyas has been taken; Devānaṁpriya (is devoted) to a zealous study of morality; to the love of morality; and to the instruction (of people) in morality.,This is the repentance of Devānāṁpriya on account of his conquest of (the country of) the Kaliṅgyas.,For; this is considered very painful and deplorable by Devānāṁpriya; that; while one is conquering an unconquered (country); slaughter; death; and deportation of people (are taking place) there.,But the following is considered even more deplorable than this by Devānāṁpriya.,(To) the Brāhmaṇas or Śramaṇas; or other sects or householders; who are living there; (and) among whom the following are practised: obedience to those who receive high pay; obedience to mother and father; obedience to elders; proper courtesy to friends; acquaintances; companions; and relatives; to slaves and servants; (and) firm devotion;–to these then happen injury or slaughter or deportation of (their) beloved ones.,Or if there are then incurring misfortune the friends; acquaintances; companions; and relatives of those whose affection (for the latter) is undiminished; although they are (themselves) well provided for; this (misfortune) as well becomes an injury to those (persons) themselves.,This is shared by all men and is considered deplorable by Devānāṁpriya.,There is no country where these (two) classes; (viz.) the Brāhmaṇas and the Śramaṇas; do not exist; except among the Yonas; and there is no (place) in any country where men are not indeed attached to some sect.,Therefore even the hundredth part or the thousandth part of all those people who were slain; who died; and who were deported at that time when (the country of) the Kaliṅgas was taken; (would) now be considered very deplorable by Devānāṁpriya.  ...,.......... desires towards all beings .......... self-control; impartiality; (and) kindness.,But this .......... by Devānāṁpriya; viz. the conquest by morality.,And this (conquest) has been won repeatedly by Devānāṁpriya both [here] and among all (his) borderers; even as far as at (the distance of) six hundred yojanas; where the Yona king named Antiyoga (is ruling); and beyond this Antiyoga; (where) four–4–kings (are ruling); (viz. the king) named Tulamaya; (the king) named Antekina; (the king) named Makā; (and the king) named Alikyashudala; (and) likewise towards the south; (where) the Choḍas and Pāṇḍyas (are ruling); as far as Tāmraparṇī.,Likewise here in the king's territory; among the Yonas and Kambojas; among the Nābhakas and Nābhapaṅktis; among the Bhojas and Pitinikyas; among the Andhras and Pāladas;–everywhere (people) are conforming to Devānāṁpriya's instruction in morality.,Even those to whom the envoys of Devānāṁpriya do not go; having heard of the duties of morality; the ordinances; (and) the instruction in morality of Devānāṁpriya; are conforming to morality and will conform to (it).,This conquest; which has been won by this everywhere; causes the feeling of satisfaction.,Firm becomes this satisfaction; (viz.) the satisfaction at the conquest by morality.,But this satisfaction is indeed of little (consequence).,Devānāṁpriya thinks that only the fruits in the other (world) are of great (value).,And for the following purpose has this rescript on morality been written; (viz.) in order that the sons (and) great-grandsons (who) may be (born) to me; should not think that a fresh conquest ought to be made; (that); if a conquest does please them; they should take pleasures in mercy and light punishments; and (that) they should regard the conquest by morality as the only (true) conquest.,This (conquest bears fruit) in this world (and) in the other world.,And let all (their) pleasure be the pleasure in exertion.,For this (bears fruit) in this world (and) in the other world.,,,,,
FOURTEENTH ROCK-EDICT,KALSI,These rescripts on morality have been caused to be written by king Devānāṁpriya Priyadarśin either in an abridged (form); or of middle (size); or at full length.,For the whole was not suitable everywhere.,For (my) dominions are wide; and much has been written; and I shall constantly cause still (more) to be written.,And (some) of this has been stated again and again because of the charm of certain topics; (and) in order that men should act accordingly.,But some of this may have been written incompletely; either on account of the locality; or because (my) motive was not liked; or by the-fault of the writer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FIRST ROCK-EDICT,GIRNAR,This rescript on morality has been caused to be written by king Devānāṁpriya Priyadarśin.,Here no living being must be killed and sacrificed.,And no festival meeting must be held.,For king Devānāṁpriya Priyadarśin sees much evil in festival meetings.,But there are also some festival meetings which are considered meritorious by king Devānāṁpriya Priyadarśin.,Formerly in the kitchen of king Devānāṁpriya Priyadarśin many hundred thousands of animals were killed daily for the sake of curry.,But now; when this rescript on morality is written; only three animals are being killed (daily) for the sake of curry; (viz.) two peacocks (and) one deer; (but) even this deer not regularly.,Even these three animals shall not be killed in future.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SECOND ROCK-EDICT,GIRNAR,Everywhere in the dominions of king Devānāṁpriya Priyadarśin; and likewise among (his) borderers; such as the Choḍas; the Pāṇḍyas; the Satiyaputa; the Ketalaputa; even Tāmraparṇī; the Yona king Antiyaka; and also the kings who are the neighbours of this Antiyaka; – everywhere two (kinds of) medical treatment were established by king Devānāṁpriya Priyadarśin; (viz.) medical treatment for men and medical treatment for cattle.,And wherever there were no herbs that are beneficial to men and beneficial to cattle; everywhere they were caused to be imported and to be planted.,Wherever there were no roots and fruits; everywhere they were caused to be imported and to be planted.,On the roads wells were caused to be dug; and trees were caused to be planted for the use of cattle and men.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
THIRD ROCK-EDICT,GIRNAR,King Devānāṁpriya Priyadarśin speaks thus.,(When I had been) anointed twelve years; the following was ordered by me.,Everywhere in my dominions the Yuktas; the Rājūka; and the Prādeśika shall set out on a complete tour (throughout their charges) every five years for this very purpose; (viz.) for the following instruction in morality as well as for other business.,‘Meritorious is obedience to mother and father. Liberality to friends; acquaintances; and relatives; to Brāhmaṇas and Śramaṇas is meritorious. Abstention from killing animals is meritorious. Moderation in expenditure (and) moderation in possessions are meritorious.’,The council (of Mahāmātras) also shall order the Yuktas to register (these rules) both with (the addition of) reasons and according to the letter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FOURTH ROCK-EDICT,GIRNAR,In times past; for many hundreds of years; there had ever been promoted the killing of animals and the hurting of living beings; discourtesy to relatives; (and) discourtesy to Brāhmaṇas and Śramaṇas.,But now; in consequence of the practice of morality on the part of king Devānāṁpriya Priyadarśin; the sound of drums has become the sound of morality; showing the people representations of aerial chariots; representations of elephants; masses of fire; and other divine figures.,Such as they had not existed before for many hundreds of years; thus there are now promoted; through the instruction in morality on the part of king Devānāṁpriya Priyadarsin; abstention from killing animals; abstention from hurting living beings; courtesy to relatives; courtesy to Brāhmaṇas and Śramaṇas; obedience to mother (and) father; (and) obedience to the aged.,In this and many other ways is the practice of morality promoted.,And king Devānāṁpriya Priyadarśin will ever promote this practice of morality.,And the sons; grandsons; and great-grandsons of king Devānāṁpriya Priyadarśin will promote this practice of morality until the æon of destruction (of the world) (and) will instruct (people) in morality; abiding by morality (and) by good conduct.,For this is the best work; viz. instruction in morality.,And the practice of morality is not (possible) for (a person) devoid of good conduct.,Therefore promotion and not neglect of this object is meritorious.,For the following purpose has this been caused to be written; (viz. in order that) they should devote themselves to the promotion of this practice; and that the neglect (of it) should not be approved (by them).,This was caused to be written by king Devānāṁpriya Priyadarśin (when he had been) anointed twelve years.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FIFTH ROCK-EDICT,GIRNAR,King Devānāṁpriya Priyadarśin speaks thus.,It is difficult to perform virtuous deeds.,He who starts performing virtuous deeds accomplishes something difficult.,Now; by me many virtuous deeds have been performed.,Therefore (among) my sons and grandsons; and (among) my descendants (who shall come) after them until the æon of destruction (of the world); those who will conform to this (duty) will perform good deeds.,But he who will neglect even a portion of this (duty) will perform evil deeds.,For sin is easily committed.,In times past (officers) called Mahāmātras of morality (Dharma-mahāmātra) did not exist before.,But Mahāmātras of morality were appointed by me (when I had been) anointed thirteen years.,These are occupied with all sects in establishing morality ……… of those who are devoted to morality (even) among the Yoṇas; Kambojas; and Gandhāras; the Risṭikas and Peteṇikas; and whatever other western borderers (of mine there are).,They are occupied with servants and masters ……… for the ……… happiness of those who are devoted to morality; (and) in freeing (them) from desire (for worldly life).,They are occupied in supporting prisoners 6 (with money) ……… (if one has) children; or with those who are bewitched (i.e. incurably ill ?) or with the aged.,They are occupied everywhere; both in Pāṭaliputra and in the outlying ……… and whatever other relatives of mine (there are).,These Mahāmātras of morality ……… whether one is eager for morality ………,For the following purpose has this rescript on morality been written ………,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SIXTH ROCK-EDlCT,GIRNAR,King Devānāṁpriya Priyadarśin speaks thus.,In times past neither the disposal of affairs nor the submission of reports at any time did exist before.,But I have made the following (arrangement).,Reporters are posted everywhere; (with instructions) to report to me the affairs of the people at any time; while I am eating; in the harem; in the inner apartment; even at the cowpen; in the palanquin; and in the parks.,And everywhere I am disposing of the affairs of the people.,And if in the council (of Mahāmātras) a dispute arises; or an amendment is moved; in connexion with any donation or proclamation which I myself am ordering verbally; or (in connexion with) an emergent matter which has been delegated to the Mahāmātras; it must be reported to me immediately; anywhere; (and) at any time.,Thus I have ordered.,For I am never content in exerting myself and in dispatching business.,For I consider it my duty (to promote) the welfare of all men.,But the root of that (is) this; (viz.) exertion and the dispatch of business.,For no duty is more important than (promoting) the welfare of all men.,And whatever effort I am making; (is made) in order that I may discharge the debt (which I owe) to living beings; (that) I may make them happy in this (world); and (that) they may attain heaven in the other (world).,For the following purpose has this rescript on morality been caused to be written; (viz.) that it may last long; and that my sons; grandsons; and great-grandsons may conform to this for the welfare of all men.,But it is difficult to accomplish this without great zeal.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SEVENTH ROCK-EDICT,GIRNAR,King Devānāṁpriya Priyadarśin desires (that) all sects may reside everywhere.,(For) all these desire both self-control and purity of mind.,But men possess various desires (and) various passions.,Either they will fulfil the whole; or they will fulfil (only) a portion (of their duties).,But even one who (practises) great liberality; (but) does not possess self-control; purity of mind; gratitude; and firm devotion; is very mean.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EIGHTH ROCK-EDICT,GIRNAR,In times past kings used to set out on pleasure-tours.,On these (tours) hunting and other such pleasures were (enjoyed).,But when king Devānāṁpriya Priyadarśin had been anointed ten years; he went to Saṁbodhi.,Therefore these tours of morality (were undertaken).,On these (tours) the following 3 takes place; (viz.) visiting Brāhmaṇas and Śramaṇas and making gifts (to them); visiting the aged and supporting (them) with gold; visiting the people of the country; instructing (them) in morality; and questioning (them) about morality; as suitable for this (occasion).,This second period (of the reign) of king Devānāṁpriya Priyadarśin becomes a pleasure in a higher degree.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
NINTH ROCK-EDICT,GIRNAR,King Devānāṁpriya Priyadarśin speaks thus.,Men are practising various ceremonies during illness; or at the marriage of a son or a daughter; or at the birth of a son; or when setting out on a journey; on these and other (occasions) men are practising various ceremonies.,But in such (cases) women are practising many and various vulgar and useless ceremonies.,Now; ceremonies should certainly be practised.,But ceremonies like these bear little fruit indeed.,But the following practice bears much fruit; viz. the practice of morality.,Herein the following (are comprised); (viz.) proper courtesy to slaves and servants; reverence to elders/ gentleness to animals; (and) liberality to Brāhmaṇas and Śramaṇas; these and other such (virtues) are called the practice of morality.,Therefore a father; or a son; or a brother; or a master ought to say:-' This is meritorious. This practice should be observed until the (desired) object is attained.',And it has been said also: ‘Gifts are meritorious.’,But there is no such gift or benefit as the gift of morality or the benefit of morality.,Therefore a friend; or a well-wisher; or a relative; or a companion should indeed admonish (another) on such and such an occasion: – ‘This ought to be done; this is meritorious. By this (practice) it is possible to attain heaven.’,And what is more desirable than this; viz. the attainment of heaven?  ...  ...,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TENTH ROCK-EDICT,GIRNAR,King Devānāṁpriya Priyadarśin does not think that either glory or fame conveys much advantage; except (on account of his aim that) in the present time; and in the distant (future); men may (be induced) by him to practise obedience to morality; and that they may conform to the duties of morality.,On this (account) king Devānāṁpriya Priyadarśin is desiring glory and fame.,But whatever effort king Devānāṁpriya Priyadarśin is making; all that (is) for the sake of (merit) in the other (world); (and) in order that all (men) may run little danger.,But the danger is this; viz. demerit.,But it is indeed difficult either for a lowly person or for a high one to accomplish this without great zeal (and without) laying aside every (other aim).10,But among these (two) it is indeed (more) difficult to accomplish for a high (person).,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
ELEVENTH ROCK-EDICT,GIRNAR,King Devānāṁpriya Priyadarśin speaks thus.,There is no such gift as the gift of morality; or acquaintance through morality; or the distribution of morality; or kinship through morality.,Herein the following are (comprised); (viz.) proper courtesy to slaves and servants; obedience to mother (and) father; liberality to friends; acquaintances; and relatives; to Brāhmaṇas and Śramaṇas;(and) abstention from killing animals.12,Concerning this a father; or a son; or a brother; or a friend; an acquaintance; or a relative; (or) even (mere) neighbours; ought to say : ‘This is meritorious. This; ought to be done.’,If one is acting thus; the attainment of (happiness) in this world is (secured); and endless merit is produced in the other (world) by that gift of morality.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
TWELFTH ROCK-EDICT,GIRNAR,King Devānaṁpriya Priyadarśin is honouring all sects: both ascetics and householders; both with gifts and with honours of various kinds he is honouring them.,But Devānaṁpriya does not value either gifts. or honours so (highly) as (this); (viz.) that a promotion of the essentials of all sects should take place.,But a promotion of the essentials (is possible) in many ways.,But its root is this; viz. guarding (one’s) speech (i. e) that neither praising one’s own sect nor blaming other sect should take place on improper occasions; or (that) it should be moderate in every case.,But other sects ought to be duly honoured in every case.,If one is acting thus; he is both promoting his own sect and benefiting other sects.,If one is acting otherwise than.. thus; he is. both hurting his own sect and wronging other sects as well.,For whosoever praises his own sect or blames other sects;–all (this) out of devotion to his own sect; (i.e.) with the view of glorifying his ow.n sect;–if he is acting thus; he rather injures his own sect very severely.,Therefore concord alone is meritorious; (i.e.) that they should both hear and obey each other's morals.,For this is the desire of Devānaṁpriya; (viz.) that all sects should be full of learning; and should be pure in doctrine.,And those who are attached to their respective (sects) ought to be spoken to 1 (as follows).,Devānaṁpriya does not value either gifts or honours so (highly) as (this); (viz.) that a promotion of the essentials of all sects should take place.,And many (officers) are occupied for this purpose; (viz.) the Mahāmātras of morality; the Mahāmātras controlling women; the inspectors of cowpens; and other classes (of officials).,And this is the fruit of it; (viz.) that both the promotion of one's own sect takes place; and the glorification of morality.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

FOURTEENTH ROCK-EDICT,GIRNAR,These rescripts on morality have been caused to be written by king Devānaṁpriya Priyadarsin either in an abridged {form); or of middle (size); or at full length.,And the whole was not suitable everywhere.,For (my) dominions are wide; and much has been written; and· I shall cause still (more) to be written.,And some of this has been stated again and again because of the charm of certain topics; (and) in order that men should act accordingly.,In some instances (some) of this may have been written incompletely; either on account of the locality; or because (my) motive was not liked; or by the fault of the writer.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FIRST SEPARATE ROCK-EDICT,DHAULI,At the word of Devānāṁpriya; the Mahāmātras at Tosali; (who are) the judicial officers of the city; have to be told (thus).,Whatever I recognize (to be right); that I strive to carry out by deeds; and to accomplish by (various) means.,And this is considered by me the principal means for this object; viz. (to give) instruction to you.,For you are occupied with many thousands of men; with the object of gaining the affection of men.,All men are my children.,As on behalf of (my own) children I desire that they may be provided with complete welfare and happiness in this world and in the other world; the same I desire also on behalf of [all]men.,And you do not learn how far this (my) object reaches.,Some single person only learns this; (and) even he (only) a portion; (but) not the whole.,Now you must pay attention to this; although you are well provided for.,It happens in the administration (of justice) that a single person suffers either imprisonment or harsh treatment.,In this case (an order) cancelling the imprisonment is (obtained) by him accidentally; while [many] other people continue to suffer.,In this case you must strive to deal (with all of them) impartially.,But one fails to act (thus) on account of the following dispositions: envy; anger; cruelty; hurry; want of practice; laziness; (and) fatigue.,(You) must strive for this; that these dispositions may not arise to you.,And the root of all this is the absence of anger and the avoidance of hurry.,He who is fatigued in the administration (of justice); will not rise; but one ought to move; to walk; and to advance.,He who will pay attention to this; must tell you: ‘See that (you) discharge the debt (which you owe to the king); such and such is the instruction of Devānāṁpriya.’,The observance of this produces great fruit; (but its) non-observance (becomes) a great evil.,For if one fails to observe this; there will be neither attainment of heaven nor satisfaction of the king.,For how (could) my mind be pleased if one badly fulfils this duty?,But if (you) observe this; you will attain heaven; and you will discharge the debt (which you owe) to me.,And this edict must be listened to (by all on (every day of) the constellation Tishya.,And it may be listened to even by a single (person) also on frequent (other) occasions between (the days of) Tishya.,And if (you) act thus; you will be able to fulfil (this duty).,For the following purpose has this rescript been written here; (viz.) in order that the judicial officers of the city may strive at all times (for this); (that] neither undeserved fettering nor undeserved harsh treatment are happening to [men].,And for the following purpose I shall send out every five years [a Mahāmātra] who will be neither harsh nor fierce; (but) of gentle actions; (viz. in order to ascertain) whether (the judicial officers); paying attention to this object; ..... are acting thus; as my instruction (implies).,But from Ujjayinī also the prince (governor) will send out for the same purpose ….. a person of the same description; and he will not allow (more than) three years to pass (without such a deputation).  (BB) In the same way (an officer will be deputed) from Takshaśilā also.

SECOND SEPARATE ROCK-EDICT,DHAULI,At the word of Devānāṁpriya; the prince (governor) and the Mahāmātras at Tosalī have to be told (thus).,Whatever I recognize (to be right); that .......... and to accomplish by (various) means.,And this is considered by me the principal means for this object; viz. .......... to you.,.......... my .....,As on behalf of (my own) children I desire that they may be provided with complete welfare and happiness in this world and in the other world; thus ..........,It might occur to (my) unconquered borderers (to ask): ‘What does the king desire with reference to us?’,[This] alone is my wish with reference to the borderers; that they may learn that Devānāṁpriya .......... that they may not be afraid of me; but may have confidence (in me); that they may obtain only happiness from me; not misery; that they may [learn] this; that Devānāṁpriya will forgive them what can be forgiven; that they may (be induced) by me (to) practise morality; (and) that they may attain (happiness in) this world and (in) the other world.,For the following purpose I am instructing you; (viz. that) I may discharge the debt (which I owe to them) by this; that I instruct (you) and inform (you) of (my) will; i.e. my unshakable resolution and vow.,Therefore; acting thus; (you) must fulfil (your) duty and must inspire confidence to them; in order that they may learn that Devānāṁpriya is to them like a father; that Devānāṁpriya loves them like himself; and that they are to Devānāṁpriya like (his own) children.,Therefore; having instructed (you); and having informed you of (my) will; I shall have (i.e. entertain) officers in (all) provinces for this object.,For you are able to inspire confidence in those (borderers) and (to secure their) welfare and happiness in this world and in the other world.,And if (you) act thus; you will attain heaven; .and will discharge the debt (which you owe) to me.,And for the following purpose has this rescript been written here; (viz.) in order that the Mahāmātras may strive at all times to inspire confidence to those borderers (of mine) and (to induce them) to practise morality.,And this rescript must be listened to (by all every four months on (the day of) the constellation Tishya.,But if desired; it may be listened to even by a single (person) also on frequent (other) occasions between (the days of) Tishya.,If (you) act thus; you will be able to carry out (my orders).,,,,,,,,,,,,,
FIRST PILLAR-EDICT,DELHI-TOPRA,King Devānāṃpriya Priyadarśin speaks thus.,This rescript on morality was caused to be written by me (when I had been) anointed twenty-six years.,(Happiness) in this (world) and in the other (world) is difficult to secure without great love of morality; careful examination; great obedience; great fear (of sin); (and) great energy.,But indeed by my instruction this regard for morality and love of morality have been promoted day by day and will progress still (more).,And my agents also; both the high ones and the low ones; and those of middle rank; are conforming to and practising (morality); (and are thus) able to stir up fickle (persons).,In the same way the Mahāmātras of the borderers also (are acting).,For (their) instruction (is) this; viz. to protect according to morality; to dispose according to morality; to cause pleasure according to morality; (and) to guard (their speech) according to morality.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
SECOND PILLAR-EDICT,DELHI-TOPRA,King Devānāṃpriya Priyadarśin speaks thus.,(To practise) morality is meritorious; but what does morality include?,(It includes) few sins; many virtuous deeds; compassion; liberality; truthfulness; (and) purity.,The gift of spiritual insight also has been bestowed by me in many ways.,On bipeds and quadrupeds; on birds and aquatic animals various benefits have been conferred by me; (even) to the boon of life.,And many other virtuous deeds also have been performed by me.,For the following purpose was this rescript on morality caused to be written by me; (viz.) in order that (men) might conform to it; and that it might be of long duration.,And he who will act thus will perform good deeds.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

SEVENTH PILLAR-EDICT,DELHI-TOPRA,King Devānaṃpriya Priyadadin speaks thus.,The kings who were in times past; had this desire; that men might (be made to) progress by the promotion of morality; but men were not made to progress by an adequate promotion of morality.,Concerning this; king Devānāṃpriya Priyadarśin speaks thus.,The following occurred to me.,On one hand; in times past kings had this desire; that men might (be made to) progress by an adequate promotion of morality; (but) on the other hand; men were not made to progress by an adequate promotion of morality.,How then might men (be made to) conform to (morality)?,How might men (be made to) progress by an adequate promotion of morality?,How could I elevate them by the promotion of morality?,Concerning this; king Devānāṃpriya Priyadarśin speaks thus.,The following occurred to me.,I shall issue proclamations on morality; (and) shall order instruction in morality (to be given).,Hearing this; men will conform to (it); will be elevated; and will (be made to) progress considerably by the promotion of morality.,For this purpose proclamations on morality were issued by me; (and) manifold instruction in morality was ordered (to be given); [in order that those agents] (of mine) too; who are occupied with many people; will exhort (them) and will explain (morality to them) in detail.,The Lajūkas also; who are occupied with many hundred thousands of men; – these too were ordered by me: ‘In such and such a manner exhort ye the people who are devoted to morality’.,Devānaṃpriya Priyadarśin speaks thus.,Having in view this very (matter); I have set up pillars of morality; appointed Mahāmātras of morality; (and) issued [proclamations] on morality.,King Devānāṃpriya Priyadarśin speaks thus.,On the roads. banyan-trees were caused to be planted by me; (in order that) they might afford shade to cattle and men; (and) mango-groves were caused to be planted.,And (at intervals) of eight kos wells were caused to be dug by me; and flights of steps (for descending into the water) were caused to be built.,Numerous drinking-places were caused to be established by me; here and there; for the enjoyment of cattle and men.,[But] this so-called enjoyment (is) [of little consequence].,For with various comforts have the people been blessed both by former kings and by myself.,But by me this has been done for the following purpose: that they might conform to that practice of morality.,Devānāṃpriya Priyadarśin speaks thus.,Those my Mahāmātras of morality too are occupied with affairs of many kinds which are beneficial to ascetics as well as to householders; and they are occupied also with all sects.,Some (Mahāmātras) were ordered by me to busy themselves with the affairs of the Samgha; likewise others were ordered by me to busy themselves also with the Brāhmaṇas (and) Ājīvikas; others were ordered by me to busy themselves also with the Nirgranthas; others were ordered by me to busy themselves also with various (other) sects; (thus) different Mahāmātras (are busying themselves} specially with different (congregations).,But my Mahāmātras of morality are occupied with these (congregations) as well as with all other sects.  (BB) King Devānāṃpriya Priyadarśin speaks thus.  (CC) Both these and many other chief (officers) are occupied with the delivery of the gifts of myself as well as of the queens; and among my whole harem [they are reporting] in diverse ways different worthy recipients of charity both here and in the provinces.  (DD) And others were ordered by me to busy themselves also with the delivery of the gifts of (my) sons and of other queens’ sons; in order (to promote) noble deeds of morality (and) the practice of morality.  (EE) For noble deeds of morality and the practice of morality (consist in) this; that (morality); viz. compassion; liberality; truthfulness; purity; gentleness; and goodness; will thus be promoted among men.  (FF) King Devānāṃpriya Priyadarśin speaks thus.  (GG) Whatsoever good deeds have been performed by me; those the people have imitated; and to those they are conforming.  (HH) Thereby they have been made to progress and will (be made to) progress in obedience to mother and father; in obedience to elders; in courtesy to the aged; in courtesy to Brāhmaṇas and Śramaṇas; to the poor and distressed; (and) even to slaves and servants.  (II) King Devānāṃpriya Priyadarśin speaks thus.  (JJ) Now this progress of morality among men has been promoted (by me) only in two ways; (viz.) by moral restrictions and by conversion.  (KK) But among these (two); those moral restrictions are of little consequence; by conversion; however; (morality is promoted) more considerably.  (LL) Now moral restrictions indeed are these; that I have ordered this; (that) certain animals are inviolable.  (MM) But there are also many other moral restrictions which have been imposed by me.  (NN) By conversion; however; the progress of morality among men has been promoted more considerably; (because it leads) to abstention from hurting living beings (and) to abstention from killing animals.  (OO) Now for the following purpose has this been ordered; that it may last as long as (my) sons and great-grandsons (shall reign and) as long as the moon and the sun (shall shine); and in order that (men) may conform to it.  (PP) For if one conforms to this; (happiness) in this (world) and in the other (world) will be attained.  (QQ) This rescript on morality was caused to be written by me (when I had been) anointed twenty-seven years.  (RR) Concerning this; Devānaṃpriya says.  (SS) This rescript on morality must be engraved there; where either stone pillars or stone slabs are (available); in order that his may be of long duration.,,
